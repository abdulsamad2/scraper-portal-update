/**
 * Tombstones — the record that a listing needs removing from the marketplace.
 *
 * Under the CSV this collection has no equivalent and needs none: a row simply
 * stops appearing in the next export and Automatiq infers the removal. An API
 * infers nothing. It removes what you name, by id, and nothing else.
 *
 * That creates a gap, because the scrapers hard-delete the Mongo document. The
 * instant the document is gone so is its stubhubListingId, and a row that no
 * longer exists cannot ask to be unlisted. So whoever removes inventory has to
 * record the removal here first, in the same transaction as the delete.
 *
 * This is also the primary safety mechanism, and the reason it is a separate
 * collection rather than a flag. Deletes originate here and nowhere else — there
 * is no code path from "my query returned no rows" to "unlist everything". A
 * failed query, an expired token or a bad deploy therefore produces zero deletes,
 * not because a guard caught it but because the delete input is a different
 * collection that simply stays empty. The blank-CSV wipe has no analogue here.
